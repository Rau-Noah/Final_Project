            <h3 class ="text-center">Hello! Thank you for viewing my final project for my degree in computer science. 
                This project took about nine weeks to develop and focuses on showing my skills with React, BootStrap5, CSS, and JSX. I wanted to create something interactive so I 
                developed three games that all have a unique way of functioning through renders. My favorite out of the games I produced is the matching game! The Info page tells you
                about how some of the games work! Please feel free to check out all pages. React is what got me the most interested in coding when I was going through my degree.</h3>

                I was able to rely on older projects and modify those components to meet my needs. For instance, I remodified an older navigation bar and its .js page to fit my needs for this 
                project.
